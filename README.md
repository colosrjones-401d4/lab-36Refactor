Lab 36 ToDo Refactor


<!-- Not quite to understand how I do this with our todo starter code Lab 31 or 32. 

Look for details and list in starter code. 

This is confusing.. 
To Do App Assignment
Refactor the To Do application to use Redux -->

You'll be given a working To Do application which you must refactor as follows:

State Management

Convert the state management to a Redux Store.

Create a Redux Store and two reducers:

A todoList reducer, to track the list
A details reducer, to track which item detail to show

<!-- Steven: Thought about adding store for details reducer and todoList reducer. 

I looked at details and list. Not sure that I am thinking about item in list.. 

To show details..  Seems fade to me and trying to think.. will wait until tomorrow review..-->

Wire up the components to subscribe to the store for state and actions

Testing
Test each reducer (without Enzyme)
